    <summary>First write / 19.4.2023</summary>
    <p>This is the first write on this website, idk what to talk about, so I'll just tell about my current linux build.</p>
    <p>
      I've been using linux for 2 years now and I have been switching between many different distros <i>(fedora -> debian -> endeavour -> arch -> void -> artix -> ...)</i>,
      but currently I've ended up back using <a href="https://endeavouros.com" target="_blank">EndeavourOS</a> with <a href="https://i3wm.org/" target="_blank">i3wm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to keep my system minimalistic, so I have only modified the default endeavour i3 config a little bit to fit my likings.
      I don't use polybar, waybar or any other bloat, I only use the default i3bar like a chad. Really just keep it simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      My old i3wm rice is public on my GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/V1li/i3-gaps-conf" target="_blank">(click here.)</a>,
      but maybe I'll release my current one some day too. Maybe after I switch distros again and get bored again of this one. <i>(nixos next?)</i>

    <summary>Linux / 24.4.2023</summary>

    <p>In this write I will tell you, why you should switch to Linux and stop using Microsoft spyware.</p>
    <p>
        First big thing is, Linux is free, privacy-friendly and open source. You can get it for free, and you can modify it to your liking.
        You can also get it on any device, from your phone to your server. You can even get it on your toaster, if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second big thing is, Linux is extremely secure. Windows is full of vulnerabilities and exploits. How many times have you heard about some new Windows exploit?
        And how many times have you heard about some new Linux exploit? Exactly. Linux is extremely secure, and you don't have to worry about your data being stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last big thing is and as I said, Linux is extremely customizable. There's endless amounts of customization options, Linux is truly yours.
    </p>
    <h3>But Linux is too hard to use!!1!</h3>
    <p>Bullshit, that's what Microsoft and the normies wants you to think. Using linux is as easy as using windows. Sometimes its even easier.</p>
    <p>There's many articles, blogs and texts about this same topic, so I'll keep this short and end this here.</p>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
